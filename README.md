Bootcamp Module 9 homework on SQL-Alchemy


## The Problem Set

I've decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with trip planning, I decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps needed to take to accomplish this task.

### Part 1: Analyse and Explore the Climate Data
In this section, I use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. Specifically, I’ll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### Part 2: Design My Climate App
Now that I’ve completed my initial analysis, I’ll design a Flask API based on the queries that I just developed.

## Data Locations
- `SurfsUp/Resources/`: contain data and the sqlite database
- `SurfsUp/climate.ipynb`: Part 1 Jupyter notebook containing exploratory data analysis and visualisation
- `SurfsUp/app.py`: Part 2 file that sets up a Flask API.
